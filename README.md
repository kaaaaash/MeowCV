MeowCV v2 😼
Real-Time Facial Expression → Cat Reaction Engine

A lightweight real-time facial expression engine built with OpenCV + MediaPipe that maps human expressions to viral TikTok cat reactions.

Now with performance monitoring, instant exit controls, and cleaner internal logic.

🧠 What’s New in v2

✅ Improved threshold tuning

✅ Real-time FPS counter

✅ Instant quit controls (Q / ESC)

✅ Cleaner expression priority logic

✅ More stable MediaPipe version handling

v2 focuses on usability, performance visibility, and cleaner engineering decisions.

⚙️ System Overview

Pipeline:

Webcam → FaceMesh → Landmark Extraction → Heuristic Engine → Cat Renderer

Detection Logic

Expressions are triggered using geometric relationships between landmarks:

Shock → Eye vertical distance exceeds threshold

Tongue → Mouth vertical distance exceeds threshold

Glare → Eye vertical distance below squint threshold

Idle → Default state

No ML training required — purely rule-based detection.

🎮 Controls
Key	Action
Q	Quit program
ESC	Quit program
📊 Performance Monitoring

FPS is calculated per frame:

fps = 1 / (current_frame_time - prev_frame_time)


Displayed in real time to:

Measure efficiency

Assist optimization

Monitor system performance

🛠 Installation
Python Version

Use:

Python 3.10 (recommended)


⚠ Python 3.13+ not supported (MediaPipe compatibility).

Setup
git clone https://github.com/kaaaaash/MeowCV.git
cd MeowCV

py -3.10 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

pip install mediapipe==0.10.9 opencv-python

Run
python main.py


Camera launches.
Expression tracking begins.
Cats judge accordingly.

🎛 Configuration

All sensitivity thresholds are adjustable in main.py.

eye_opening_threshold = 0.020
mouth_open_threshold = 0.030
squinting_threshold = 0.016


Fine-tune detection responsiveness to match your lighting and camera quality.

🚀 Future Roadmap (v3 Ideas)

Expression smoothing (reduce flicker)

Animated overlays instead of static images

Bounding box UI

Web-based version (WebRTC)

Modular expression engine (/core/expressions.py)

Plugin-style cat packs

💡 Philosophy

MeowCV v2 proves that expressive CV systems don’t need heavy ML pipelines.
Simple geometry + clean logic + performance awareness = responsive systems.

And also…
cats reacting to your face is elite software design.
